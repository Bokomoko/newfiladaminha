# Authentication Middleware with FastAPI

This document describes the use of middleware for authentication in FastAPI applications.

## Introduction

FastAPI is a modern and fast framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standards like OpenAPI and JSON Schema. To implement authentication, it is common to use middleware that intercepts requests and verifies the authenticity of the provided tokens or credentials.

## Recommended Library

The most recommended library for authentication with FastAPI is **FastAPI JWT Auth**. This library facilitates the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) based authentication in FastAPI applications.

### Features of FastAPI JWT Auth

- Full support for JWT (creation, verification, and renewal)
- Easy integration with FastAPI
- Support for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

## Documentation

For more details on how to use **FastAPI JWT Auth**, refer to the [official documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/IndominusByte/fastapi-jwt-auth).

## Conclusion

Using middleware for authentication in FastAPI is a recommended practice to ensure the security of your APIs. The **FastAPI JWT Auth** library offers a robust and easy-to-integrate solution for managing JWT-based authentication.
