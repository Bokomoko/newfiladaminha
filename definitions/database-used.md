# Database Definitions For PostgreSQL

This file contains the definitions to be used in the PostgreSQL database. Below is a list of important factors and information:

1. **Python Library**: The primary library used for interacting with PostgreSQL is `psycopg2`.

- **Dependency List**: Ensure `psycopg2` is listed in your project's dependencies.
- **Documentation**: You can find the documentation for `psycopg2` on [GitHub](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2).

1. **Migrations**: Include information on how to handle database migrations to ensure the schema is up-to-date.

1. **Indexes and Constraints**: Define any indexes and constraints that should be applied to the database tables to ensure data integrity and performance.

1. **Backup and Restore**: Outline the procedures for backing up and restoring the database to prevent data loss.

1. **Security**: Include best practices for securing the database, such as using SSL connections and managing user permissions.

1. **Containerization**: The PostgreSQL database will run inside a container. The container definition will also be included in this project in an appropriate folder.

1. **Database Schema**: Define the schema for your database, including tables, columns, and data types.

1. **Connection Settings**: Specify the connection settings required to connect to the PostgreSQL database, such as host, port, username, password, and database name.

1. **Performance Tuning**: Tips and techniques for optimizing the performance of your PostgreSQL database.

1. **Monitoring**: Tools and methods for monitoring the health and performance of your PostgreSQL database.

1. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions for troubleshooting problems with your PostgreSQL database.

1. **Data Types**:

- Use appropriate data types for each column.
- Consider using JSONB for storing JSON data.
- Use arrays for storing multiple values in a single column.

1. **Query Optimization**:

- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance.
- Avoid using SELECT * in queries.
- Use indexes to speed up query performance.

1. **Data Integrity**:

- Use foreign keys to enforce relationships between tables.
- Use CHECK constraints to enforce data validity.
- Use UNIQUE constraints to prevent duplicate values.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a well-defined and maintainable PostgreSQL database setup for your project.
