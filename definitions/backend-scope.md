# Backend Architecture Definitions

## Framework Choice: FastAPI

FastAPI has been selected as our backend framework for the following advantages:

1. **Performance**
   - Built on Starlette and Pydantic
   - One of the fastest Python frameworks available
   - Async support by default

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Automatic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Type hints and validation out of the box
   - Modern Python features (3.7+)
   - Reduced boilerplate code

3. **Data Validation**
   - Built-in request and response validation
   - Pydantic models for data serialization
   - Automatic data conversion

## ASGI Server: Uvicorn

Uvicorn will be used as our ASGI server because:

1. **Performance Benefits**
   - Lightweight and fast ASGI serverastral.sh
   - Built on uvloop and httptools
   - Optimized for async operations

2. **Integration**
   - Native FastAPI support
   - Easy configuration
   - Production-ready capabilities

## Application Context Management

The application will use a context generator pattern for managing system resources:

### Key Components:

1. **Database Connection Pool**
   - Managed lifecycle of PostgreSQL connections
   - Automatic connection cleanup
   - Connection pooling for better performance

2. **System Initialization**
   - Configuration loading
   - Service startup sequence
   - Resource allocation

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Scoped resources management
   - Testing facilitation
   - Clean separation of concerns

Example Context Structure:
```python
async def get_app_context():
    # Initialize resources
    # Yield the context
    # Cleanup on shutdown
```

### Benefits:

- Controlled resource lifecycle
- Better testing capabilities
- Clean shutdown procedures
- Proper error handling
